# Google-Chrome-Installation-Script
This script installs Google Chrome in Ubuntu.
Automating the process of installing Google Chrome on Debian-based Linux systems can save you time and effort, 
especially if you need to set up multiple machines or want to streamline the installation on your system. 
By creating a script, you can execute the entire process in a single command. 
This script incorporates the steps above such as importing Google's signing key, 
updating the package repositories, upgrading the system, downloading and installing necessary packages, and resolving dependencies. 
Once the script is ready, you can run it whenever you need to install or update Google Chrome, 
ensuring a consistent and efficient installation process across all your Ubuntu devices. 
For security never execute scripts directly from the web!
